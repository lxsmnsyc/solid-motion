Solid 2 reports reactivity mistakes as dev-mode console diagnostics rather than
as failures — an unowned effect, a flush that is a silent no-op, a top-level
prop read that will never update. None of those surface in jsdom or in an
assertion, so this walks every playground demo in a real dev build and fails on
any of them.

The demo list is scraped from the playground's own index page rather than
hard-coded, so a demo added later is covered without touching this file.
